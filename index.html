    <div id="bio">
      <p>I graduated <em>summa cum laude</em> from the Wharton School of the
        University of Pennsylvania with concentrations in Statistics and
        Business Analytics, and minors in Mathematics and English, in May 2018.
        Around that time I was also a recipient of the Rose Award for best
        undergraduate thesis. </p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>Since graduating, I have worked as a research assistant at Wharton's
        Marketing Department and dedicated most of my free time to further
        developing my undergraduate thesis research. Most of my work is focused
        on using machine learning and statistical models to explain how and why
        things go viral, or how to most efficiently model the spread of
        information in networks.</p>
      <p><br>
      </p>
      <p>I am currently applying to doctoral programs.</p>

        complicated type of hazard regression to differentiate forms of social
        influence in product diffusion within a network.<br>
